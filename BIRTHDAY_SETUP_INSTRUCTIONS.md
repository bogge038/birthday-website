# ðŸŽ‰ Birthday Website Setup Instructions

## Quick Start

Your beautiful birthday website is ready! Here's how to add your videos and customize it:

### 1. Add Your Videos
1. Create a `videos` folder inside the `public` folder
2. Add your 4 video files (each 5 seconds long) to `public/videos/`
3. Name them: `birthday-video-1.mp4`, `birthday-video-2.mp4`, `birthday-video-3.mp4`, `birthday-video-4.mp4`

### 2. Customize the Content
In `src/pages/Index.tsx`:
- Change `[Friend's Name]` to your friend's actual name
- Update the video titles and descriptions to match your videos
- Modify the text to be more personal

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
Since this is a React/Vite project (not traditional HTML/CSS/JS files), you'll need to:
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages
3. Or use GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
